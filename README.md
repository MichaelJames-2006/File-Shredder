# File-Shredder
This will shred any sensitive file you want, by scrambling the existing bytes 30 times, hence it is overwriting the original 30 times. Which means it is much safer than just deleting it.

- Please note:
  - That after running code you will still need to manually delete it. All data are scrambled and if the file are restored then it will give the scrambled version.

### Future Updates
- Auto-delete after scrambling and overwriting.
- Loop over to shred more than one file.
- Loop over and cleanup entire directories.
